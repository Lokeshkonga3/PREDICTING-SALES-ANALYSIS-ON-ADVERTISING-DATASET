## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To load and explore the `Advertising.csv` dataset.
- To perform data preprocessing and isolate relevant features.
- To build a **simple linear regression model** using **TV advertising spend** as the independent variable.
- To evaluate the model's performance using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - RÂ² Score (coefficient of determination)
- To visualize:
  - The regression line against actual data points
  - Residual distribution and diagnostic plots
  - Comparison between actual and predicted sales
- To interpret model coefficients and understand the relationship between advertising spend and sales.
